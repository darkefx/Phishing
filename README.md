You’ll get a phishing link via Cloudflare or Serveo (choose one).

🎭 Social Engineering Strategy (Key to Success)
🧠 The real power of PyPhisher is not just the tool — it’s YOU.

Only send the link when your victim is online.

Make it believable. Act like:

It’s a friend’s profile link.

A voting page or private post.

A surprise, game, or exclusive content.

📌 DO NOT rush or act suspicious.
⌛ Ask the victim to wait on the page for at least 1–2 minutes.

🎯 This is an art, not a script.
Kali can’t seduce — you can 😉
Good luck, hacker-in-training.
